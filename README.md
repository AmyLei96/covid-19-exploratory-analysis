# COVID-19: January - March 2020

## Overview
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in January 2020. Since the subsequent spread of the disease across the globe, datasets tracking the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country have become publicly available. Researchers are leveraging this data to understand the implications of coronavirus in certain countries and make predictions about the future spread of the disease. Since most countries outside of China experienced a peak in number of cases in March 2020, this analysis only examines data collected from January 22, 2020 to March 31, 2020.

## Raw Data
Raw data for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country observed by date since January 22, 2020 is aggregated by Johns Hopkins University and transformed to a CSV file by
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the ease in utility of the Python pandas and matplotlib libraries for exploratory analysis
- To highlight the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the most affected countries as of March 2020
- To suggest insights into the correlation between the effectiveness of government regulations and the increase in cases in each country
- To provide a foundation for predictive analysis

## Analysis
- Cases and deaths in China
- Cases in the most affected countries outside of China
- Comparison between deaths in China and Italy
- Cases and deaths in the United States
- Cases in the most affected states in the United States
