# COVID-19: January - March 2020

## Overview
Since the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the globe in January 2020, many datasets 
tracking the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country have become publicly available. Researchers have been able to leverage this data to understand the implications of this disease in certain countries and make predictions about the future spread of the disease.

## Raw Data
Raw data for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country observed by date since January 22, 2020 is aggregated by Johns Hopkins University and transformed to a CSV file by
[Kaggle](ttps://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the ease in utility of the pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python for exploratory analysis
- To highlight the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the most affected countries as of March 2020
- To suggest insights into the correlation between the effectiveness of governmental regulations and the increase in cases in each country
- To provide a foundation for predictive analysis
