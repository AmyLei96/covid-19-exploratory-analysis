# COVID-19: January - March 2020

## Overview
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in January 2020. Datasets tracking the number of cases and deaths in each country have become publicly available as the disease spread across the globe. Researchers are using this data to understand the implications of coronavirus in certain countries and make predictions about future spread of the disease. Since most countries outside of China experienced a peak in cases in March 2020, this analysis is based on data collected from January 22, 2020 to March 31, 2020.

## Data
Raw data for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country observed by date is aggregated by Johns Hopkins University and transformed to CSV by
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the utility of the Python pandas and matplotlib libraries for exploratory analysis
- To highlight the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the most affected countries as of March 2020
- To provide insights into the impact of government regulations on the increase in cases in each country
- To provide a foundation for predictive analysis

## Analysis
- Cases and deaths in China
- Cases in the most affected countries outside of China
- Comparison between deaths in China and Italy
- Cases and deaths in the United States
- Comparison among cases in the most affected states in the United States
